  <FaqItem question="How secure is my data at eCamp?">
    In addition to the development, the core team also maintains a freely usable
    instance. The server is operated as a best-effort. For the operation of the server we use modern cloud solutions.
    This includes regular backups and server updates. Nevertheless we cannot
    guarantee uninterrupted availability.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="What will happen to eCamp v2?">
    The original eCamp version 2 can be used at
    https://ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch until further notice. However, the code is
    getting old and difficult to maintain. For a long time there has been no further
    development for eCamp v2 except for critical bug fixes. No data
    is migrated from v2 to v3.

  <FaqItem question="I have a question about eCamp v2">
