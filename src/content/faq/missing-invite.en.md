title: I did not receive an invitation email to a camp. What can I do?
---

The person who invited you can click your email address on the team page and resend the invitation email.
Caution: Only the last sent invitation email to your email address is valid.
In case the email never arrives in your inbox nor in your SPAM folder, the camp leader can also **invite another email address** of yours.
They can even invite an email address of their own, and **forward you the invitation email**.
As soon as you get a valid invitation email through any means, you can use it to join the camp with your account.
