We are always happy to receive your feedback through the [contact form](/en/contact), on [discord](https://discord.gg/tdwtRytV6P) or in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ecamp/ecamp3/#how-can-i-help).<br/>
If your idea is something big, please keep in mind that eCamp v3 is not and can never be the single IT tool you will ever use to organize your camp. The management of participants, the budget or the menu of your camp are examples of things that will always have to happen outside of eCamp v3. Therefore, finding or creating an external tool for your big idea might be a better fit. This new tool may then be connected to eCamp v3 or other tools if relevant, to make working with them easier.<br/>
IT tools can quickly get outdated. Therefore we try to limit the responsibility of each tool, so it will be easier to replace with something new. This approach is also recommended by the [IT strategy guidelines](https://itkompass.scout.ch/#/it-guidelines/principles) of the Swiss scout movement.<br/>
So, maybe don't think of eCamp v3 as the center of your camp. Maybe your file storage platform is the place where all the relevant documents for your camp are gathered. Or maybe, if you are in the scouts, you can use the [Portal](https://portal.scout.ch/) as the entry point and quick connection to all the tools you use.
