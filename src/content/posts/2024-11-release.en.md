The days are getting shorter and the first courses of the spring season are probably already being planned. With the support of the so-called checklists, we are releasing an elementary missing feature for course planning.


<div class="simple-columns">

<div>

Checklists can now be created under camp/course administration. This feature was developed specifically for the implementation of Y+S checklists. However, the feature can also be used for any kind of requirements, content specifications, etc.

<small>
To avoid any misunderstandings, we would like to clarify that the “Checklists” feature is not a replacement for the “To-do list” from eCamp V2.

When creating a new checklist, its content can optionally be imported from a template. We have currently entered some PBS checklists.

<div>

The “Checklist” module can be added in the activity in order to select checklist entries afterwards. It is advisable to add this module to the relevant categories (e.g. training blocks) after creating a course. We will shortly be creating a course template that already contains useful predefined categories.

When printing, there is now the option to print a block overview. This can be used for course registration. This block overview prints all activities, only with the “Checklist” module and the free text fields “Block objectives” and “Block contents” - but without detailed content.

![Checklisten-Übersicht anzeigen](~/assets/images/2024-11/checklist-overview-de.webp)

<div>

An overview can be displayed in the main navigation to check which checklist entries are covered by which activities.
