title: How can I add images, files or tables?
---

**Images/Files**: Currently it is not possible to upload files directly to eCamp v3.
It would take us precious time and money and would never come close to the features of Google Drive etc.
You can however upload images/files to an external service like Google Drive or Dropbox and then add a link to it.

**Tables**: Currently it is not possible to insert tables directly into eCamp v3.
Some experiments with simple tables have taken place, but for more complex cases we are currently blocked by the PDF export #2.
