title: Who is eCamp v3 intended for?
---

eCamp v3 is intended for anyone planning a camp, be it scouts, Jubla, Cevi, other Y+S camps or even school camps, music camps or other types of camps. In the past, eCamp v2 has already been used to plan some weddings and festival visits.<br/>
For this reason, we try to avoid adding wording or features specific to any one organization, and try to keep eCamp v3 useable and helpful for most of these organizations.<br/>
The features of eCamp v3 are optimized for multiple people collaborating on the same camp, and the languages offered are so far limited to the ones used in Switzerland, although you could help us translate eCamp v3 into another language.
