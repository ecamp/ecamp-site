    question: "Wie kann ich euch helfen?",
    answer: `Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot.

    Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. `,

    question: "What's an example of when you changed your mind?",
    answer: `Michael Knight a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law. Here he comes Here comes Speed Racer. He's a demon on wheels.`,

    question: "What is something that you would really like to try again?",
    answer: `A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears!

      It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in.`,

    question:
      "If you could only ask one question to each person you meet, what would that question be?",
