Data protection is an important topic for us, and we process your data only in accordance with the legal regulations. In these terms of service, we describe how we handle data and which rights you possess in that process.

## Acceptance of the Terms of Service
By accessing and using this application, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with the Terms of Service, you should not access _eCamp_ or use its content and features.

## Terms
### _ecamp3_, _eCamp_ and &ldquo;the application&rdquo;
_ecamp3_ is open source software (see term below) that is intended to simplify the planning of Y+S camps, Y+S courses and other camps.
The source code of the _ecamp3_ software is publicly available on GitHub at [https://github.com/ecamp/ecamp3](https://github.com/ecamp/ecamp3){target=_blank} and is subject to the &ldquo;GNU Affero General Public License v3.0&rdquo; license, see term below.

_eCamp_ is the name of the public instance of _ecamp3_ which we operate, and is also called &ldquo;the application&rdquo; in the following text. The application can be accessed at the URL [https://ecamp3.ch](https://ecamp3.ch/){target=_blank}.

### Users
Users are natural persons like you, who want to use the planning features of _eCamp_ and manage content on _eCamp_. If you want to use _eCamp_ and enter content, you need a user account.

### User account
A user account allows you to create and collaborate on camps. To create a user account you need a name, a valid email address and a password, or alternatively an account on a supported OAuth service (see term below). Your name and email address are visible to all other users who collaborate with you on camps.

### Supported OAuth services
_eCamp_ offers the possibility of simplified registration and login via the OAuth interfaces of various external services, including MiData of the Swiss Scouts and Guides Movement, cevi.db of YMCA Switzerland, jubla.db of Jungwacht Blauring (see terms below) and via a Google account. When registering or logging in via one of these services, your external account identity is stored in _eCamp_ instead of a password, along with your name and email address.

### User content
Users enter content on _eCamp_ during camp planning. The user content includes the data created by your use of the application (program planning, material lists, safety concepts, …).

### _eCamp Core Team_
The initiative for the software project _ecamp3_ and the application _eCamp_ came from the _eCamp Core Team_, a team of volunteer developers. In exchange with camp leaders of the Swiss Scout Movement, among others, requirements were collected and the application _eCamp_ was launched. The _eCamp Core Team_ sees itself as part of an open community of youth associations and other user organizations. As application operator, the _eCamp Core Team_ is responsible for the safe use and operation of the _eCamp_ application.

### DigitalOcean
The _eCamp_ application is run on a managed Kubernetes cloud from the company DigitalOcean. The user contents and personal data are stored and processed on servers in Frankfurt, Germany. Details see [https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-our-new-european-region-frankfurt](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-our-new-european-region-frankfurt){target=_blank}.

### Cloudflare
When your browser accesses _eCamp_, the communication runs via servers from the US company [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/){target=_blank}. Among other things, these servers prevent large-scale hacker attacks against _eCamp_.

### SendGrid
Outgoing emails from _eCamp_ are sent via the US company [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/){target=_blank}.

### ImprovMX
Incoming e-mails to @ecamp3.ch e-mail addresses are received via the [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/){target=_blank} service of the French company Reflectiv SAS and via the [GMail](https://mail.google.com/){target=_blank} service of Google.

### hitobito / MiData / cevi.db / jubla.db
The membership management solutions of the Swiss Scouts and Guides Movement (MiData), YMCA Switzerland (cevi.db) and Jungwacht Blauring (jubla.db) are all based on the open source software [hitobito](https://hitobito.com/){target=_blank} and are operated by the Swiss company [Puzzle ITC](https://puzzle.ch/){target=_blank}.

### reCAPTCHA
To prevent spam, Google's [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/){target=_blank} service is used for certain operations, including user account registration and password resetting.

### Sentry
Any errors that occur in the application are automatically sent to the [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/){target=_blank} service provided by the US company Sentry. The _eCamp Core Team_ can then view this information collected in one place and use it for troubleshooting.

### AWS S3
We regularly store encrypted backups of the content on _eCamp_ on Amazon's AWS S3 service, in a data center in Paris.

### Netlify
We use the services of the US company [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/){target=_blank} for hosting our landing page [https://ecamp3.ch](https://ecamp3.ch) and all of its subpages (except the actual application at [https://app.ecamp3.ch](https://app.ecamp3.ch){target=_blank}). In order to improve the user experience of the landing page, we use the analytics tools of Netlify.

### Open source software
Open source software refers to software whose source code is published under an open source license and can therefore be freely edited and distributed. Behind this is the open-source model: open source software can help people all over the world, and conversely, people all over the world can contribute to the improvement of open source software by working together on it.

There are various open source licenses with different characteristics and regulations on topics such as (commercial) reusability, operation, the right to edit and create derivative works, as well as obligations regarding the open source status and license of these derivative works.

### GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
The source code of _ecamp3_ is published and protected under a license called [&ldquo;GNU Affero General Public License v3.0&rdquo;](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/){target=_blank}. This license defines the rights and obligations in the use of the software. However, this only applies to the source code: The user content on _eCamp_ is not under this license.

## Terms of Service
### Ground rules
The application _eCamp_ is a web application which should facilitate the cooperation in the planning of camps and courses. The content on this application comes from the users themselves. As a user you are obliged to behave conscientiously and in accordance with this goal.

All users are responsible for the correct use of the application and for the legality of the content.

Our [Code of Conduct](/en/code-of-conduct) applies throughout the application.

The _eCamp Core Team_ reserves the right to remove from the application any content that contradicts the Terms of Service or the Code of Conduct. However, this is done only with the intention of preserving the basic purpose of the _eCamp_ application. The _eCamp Core Team_ also reserves the right to temporarily suspend the activities of a user of the application by:

* making the user content invisible,
* deactivating the user's account
* issuing a warning.

This applies in particular and without limitation in the following cases:

* if there is a violation of applicable law,
* if there is a violation of these Terms of Service or
* if the _eCamp Core Team_ is of the opinion that the activity of the user is harmful to others or to the application or its operation.

### User content

#### Required rights to content
By using this application, you confirm that you have the necessary (copyright) rights to all content which you enter on the application. In particular, you may not submit any content that infringes any registered trademarks or patents.

#### Intellectual property
By using this app, you agree to release all content you create or submit (minus the personal information in your profile) under a [CC0 &ldquo;No rights reserved&rdquo;](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/){target=_blank} license.
This allows anyone who collaborates with you in camps to freely reuse, copy, adapt and publish your content without citing a source. The reason for this is the common practice of reusing old camp program in new camps in an adapted form. This license does not release your content from any rights that others may have in your content, including but not limited to [Persönlichkeitsrechte](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pers%C3%B6nlichkeitsrecht_(Schweiz)){target=_blank}. You are therefore still responsible for ensuring that your content does not offend anyone and that the [Code of Conduct](/en/code-of-conduct) is adhered to.

#### Correction or deletion procedure
Any person may request the correction or hiding of content that does not comply with these Terms of Service. The content in question can be reported via the [contact form](/en/contact). The _eCamp Core Team_ or its authorized content owners will process the request and reserve the right to conduct any necessary review or clarification prior to correcting or hiding any content.

### Security

The _eCamp Core Team_ works, as far as the voluntary commitment allows, to keep the application regularly on a sufficiently up-to-date technical level to avoid security vulnerabilities. Due to the limited time of our volunteers and the large amount of content coming directly from the users, there is no guarantee that _eCamp_ is 100% secure at any given time.

It is forbidden to store malware in any form on _eCamp_ or to distribute it via _eCamp_. Users must also ensure that linked websites are not compromised, i.e. that no unauthorized intrusion into a computer system is possible, e.g. through malware.

If you identify users who do not comply with the Terms of Service or content that contradicts the Terms of Service, you are obliged to report this to the _eCamp Core Team_, for example via [contact form](/en/contact).

### Development and operation

The development as well as the operation of _eCamp_ is based on voluntary work of the _eCamp Core Team_ and the community. Therefore, the operation of the application runs under &ldquo;best effort&rdquo;. There are no guarantees for availability of the application or timely or desired implementation of bug fixes or changes.

The _eCamp Core Team_ reserves the right to roll out new software updates to the application at any time. The application may therefore change without prior notice and existing functionality may be modified or removed. In this context, there may be brief interruptions during which _eCamp_ is not available.

We ask you to report bugs and suggestions for improvement to the _eCamp Core Team_. This way the _eCamp_ application can be improved continuously.

### Free use of the application

The use of _eCamp_ is offered free of charge by the _eCamp Core Team_, with the kind support of [Swiss Guide and Scout Movement](https://scout.swiss/){target=_blank} and [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/){target=_blank}.

### Liability disclaimer
All information provided and made available to the respective user on this application including media as well as the underlying software are provided "as is" and "subject to availability". The _eCamp Core Team_ hereby disclaims any liability for defects, warranties or representations to the extent permitted by law. This applies in particular to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third party rights. The _eCamp Core Team_ does not warrant that _eCamp_ will meet your requirements or that it will be uninterrupted, secure, error-free or complete; of course, we do our best to keep the application safe and reliable.

Downloading or otherwise obtaining material through the use of this application is done at your own discretion and risk. The _eCamp Core Team_ is not liable for any damage to your computer system or loss of data resulting from downloading due to viruses or other harmful components.

The application may contain third party content or hyperlinks to third party websites. The _eCamp Core Team_ has no control over these websites and is under no circumstances liable for the content of a third party website which is hyperlinked to this application. This includes, but is not limited to, the accuracy, content, quality or timeliness of that website.

## Privacy Policy
### Legal basis

The processing of personal data collected in connection with the operation of the _eCamp_ application is subject to the Swiss Federal Law on Data Protection (DSG 235.1).

### Collection of data

_eCamp_ is powered by user content created by users with a user account, for details see chapter Terms.

We collect your personal data directly from you or in connection with the use of the website (e.g. IP address, MAC address of the smartphone or computer, information about your device and settings, cookies, date and time of the visit, pages and content accessed, functions used, referring websites). If you register or log in via an external login service such as Google or hitobito (see chapter Terms), we also obtain data from these services after your explicit consent. In your user account, we only permanently store the data that is absolutely necessary for the application.

### Data disclosure

As part of the provision of our services, as well as the provision of our web application, we may be dependent on the services of third parties. In this context, it may happen that we commission third parties with the processing of your personal data. In this case, we ensure that these third parties comply with the requirements of data protection. Under certain circumstances, we are also obliged to disclose your data to authorities or other third parties.

The following third parties can be or are involved in the context of the services (see chapter Terms for further explanations):

* Hosting platform operator DigitalOcean
* Spam protection and DNS server Cloudflare
* Mail services Sendgrid and ImprovMX / Reflectiv SAS
* Google, via reCAPTCHA, if you contact the _eCamp Core Team_ via email or contact form, and if you register or log in via a Google account
* hitobito / Puzzle ITC, if you register or log in via MiData, cevi.db or jubla.db
* Sentry, in case of errors in the software
* Amazon, in the form of encrypted database backups

We will only share your personal information if one of the following conditions is met:

* your consent has been given;
* there is a legal obligation;
* if this is necessary for the functionality of the features you use;
* if this is necessary for the enforcement of our rights, in particular the enforcement of claims arising from the Terms of Service;
* if we have a legitimate interest in doing so and your contrary interests do not outweigh our interests;
* if any other legal permission exists.

Some of the services used belong to companies outside Switzerland. Therefore, your personal data may also be transferred to these companies abroad as part of the order processing. These companies are obligated to data protection to the same extent as we are. If the level of data protection in the country in which data is transferred does not correspond to that of Switzerland or the European Union, we ensure that the same level of protection is guaranteed as in Switzerland or the European Union.

If data is transferred to a company in the USA, we ensure that this company is certified in accordance with the Swiss or EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement, thus ensuring that the level of data protection in Switzerland or the EU is complied with. In the absence of certification, we obtain the necessary guarantees by contract.

### Data security
We take data security very seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or against unauthorized third-party access. We continuously improve our security measures in line with technological developments.

For secure data transmission, we use the TLS (Transport Layer Security) method in conjunction with the highest encryption level supported by your browser. You can check that all pages of our application are transmitted encrypted by the closed representation of the lock symbol in the status bar of your browser.

You can verify the authenticity of the _eCamp_ application at any time by checking the validity of the digital server certificate.

### Individual data processing operations
#### Deployment of the application and creation of log files

When you access our website, DigitalOcean (for details see chapter Terms) automatically collects and stores information, which your browser transmits to us. This information, stored in so-called server log files, is:

* server name
* IP address
* operating system
* device type
* Browser name and version
* Date and time of server request

This data cannot be assigned to a specific person and there is no merging of this data with other data sources. The log files are stored in order to guarantee the functionality of the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. The storage of log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website, you therefore have no possibility to object to this.

Server log files are stored for a maximum of 5 days.

#### Backups

For a period of 7 days, the hosting company DigitalOcean automatically keeps backups of eCamp content.

In addition, we store longer-term backups for up to a year on an AWS S3 bucket from Amazon. These backups are only transmitted and stored on Amazon in encrypted form in a data center in Paris. This serves as a safeguard against data center failures at DigitalOcean.

#### Use of cookies

Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are placed on your device's operating system by your browser when you visit our website. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses.

We exclusively use so-called "session cookies". These are automatically deleted upon logout or after 12 hours. They are also absolutely necessary for the login function, so you have no way to object to them. However, the cookies are stored on your computer. You therefore have full control and can delete them completely or restrict the transfer by changing the settings in your browser. If you deactivate cookies for _eCamp_, you will no longer be able to log in and thus no longer be able to use the application.

#### Landing page [https://ecamp3.ch](https://ecamp3.ch)

In order to continuously improve our landing page [https://ecamp3.ch](https://ecamp3.ch) and its subpages, we use the analytics tools of Netlify. Netlify collects only minimal and anonymized data about your visit, and does not use cookies. By continuing to use this website, you agree to Netlify's analytics tool.
No Netlify analytics are collected when using the actual application [https://app.ecamp3.ch](https://app.ecamp3.ch) and its subpages.

#### Registration of a user account

We distinguish two levels of users:

1. without registration: you can freely and anonymously access and move around the purely informative home page [https://ecamp3.ch](/en/).
2. to use the actual camp planning functions of our application, registration is required. This requires creating a user account with a name, a valid email address and a password, or with an account on a supported OAuth service. During registration, you must accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you create an account with a password, after filling out the registration form you will receive a confirmation email for verification purposes. Only then will your user account be activated. From then on you can add to your user profile or change your password if necessary.

#### Viewing your data

All personal data that we permanently store about you can be viewed at any time in your user profile.

#### Deleting your user account

If you no longer wish to maintain your account, you can [contact](/en/contact) us to request deletion. This will irrevocably delete all of your personal data (not the user content). If you want to use _eCamp_ again, you have to register again. All user content will remain for transparency, traceability and further use in future camps, but will be assigned to an anonymous user account.

#### Contact via contact form

You have the possibility to contact the _eCamp Core Team_ via the [contact form](/en/contact). If you contact us via email, the following data will be processed:

* email address
* Content of your e-mail
* subject of your e-mail
* date
* Contact details provided by you (e.g. name, surname)

Your data will be stored for the purpose of processing your request and in case of follow-up questions.

We store your data only as long as this is necessary for the completion of your request or as long as we are required by law.

We would like to point out that e-mails can be read or changed unauthorized and unnoticed during transmission. The spam filter can reject e-mails if they are identified as spam by certain characteristics.

## Final regulations
### Choice of law and place of jurisdiction

These Terms of Service and their interpretation shall be governed in their entirety by Swiss law. The exclusive place of jurisdiction is Zurich.

### Changes to these terms

Furthermore, the _eCamp Core Team_ reserves the right to restrict or deny access to the application in whole or in part without prior notice and without giving reasons.

### Severability clause
