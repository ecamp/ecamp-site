title: Can I add tasks/todos in eCamp?
---

No. We have decided not to support task lists anymore,
as they were rarely used in the past and better alternatives are available.
If you have used the eCamp v2 schedule list,
you can now use the [Calendar Generator in Hering](https://scout-ch.github.io/hering/#/calendar).
