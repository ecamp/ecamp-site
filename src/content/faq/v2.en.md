title: What will happen to eCamp v2?
---

The original eCamp v2 can be used at [ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch](https://ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch) until further notice.
However, the code is getting old and difficult to maintain. That's why we only fix critical bugs at most.<br/>
No data is migrated from v2 to v3. After we've also implemented the course functionality in eCamp v3,
we will probably put eCamp v2 into a read-only mode and make it no longer editable.
