<FaqSection title="Questions & Answers">
    <FaqItem question="How secure is my data at eCamp?">
        In addition to the development, the core team also maintains a freely usable
        instance. The server is operated as a best-effort. For the operation of the server we use modern cloud solutions.
        This includes regular backups and server updates. Nevertheless we cannot
        guarantee uninterrupted availability.

    <FaqItem question="What will happen to eCamp v2?">
        The original eCamp v2 can be used at [ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch](https://ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch) until further notice.
        However, the code is getting old and difficult to maintain. That's why we only fix critical bugs at most.<br/>
        No data is migrated from v2 to v3. After we've also implemented the course functionality in eCamp v3,
        we will probably put eCamp v2 into a read-only mode and make it no longer editable.
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem question="I have a question about eCamp v2">
        For questions/support about eCamp v2 please use the support function in
        eCamp v2 directly. No questions about eCamp v2 are answered on
        this page.
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem question="Who is behind eCamp?">
        eCamp is developed by a [core team of volunteers](/en/team). The source code is published as
        open source. Community participation is actively encouraged.
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem question="Can I add tasks/todos in eCamp?">
        No. We have decided not to support task lists anymore,
        as they were rarely used in the past and better alternatives are available.
        If you have used the eCamp v2 schedule list,
        you can now use the [Calendar Generator in Hering](https://scout-ch.github.io/hering/#/calendar).

    <FaqItem question="I miss the featureâ€¦">
        We will not be implementing all the features from eCamp v2 in eCamp v3 in the future.<br/>
        What we currently have planned: Special daily responsibilities, material checkbox,
        and displaying block status in the overview program.

    <FaqItem question="Does anybody support you financially?">
        Operating costs are funded by the [Swiss Guide and Scout Movement](https://pfadi.swiss/).
        This landing page is powered by the open source plan of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
        and our application translations are managed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/).

    <FaqItem question="Are past camps also visible on eCamp v3?">
        Only camps created on eCamp v3 are visible on eCamp v3.
        Past camps from eCamp v2 are not visible, but can still be viewed on eCamp v2.
    </FaqItem>
    <FaqItem question="How can I add images, files or tables?">
        **Images/Files**: Currently it is not possible to upload files directly to eCamp v3.
        It would take us precious time and money and would never come close to the features of Google Drive etc.
        You can however upload images/files to an external service like Google Drive or Dropbox and then add a link to it.

        **Tables**: Currently it is not possible to insert tables directly into eCamp v3.
        This feature is currently blocked by the PDF export #2.
