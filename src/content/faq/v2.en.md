title: What will happen to eCamp v2?
---

The original eCamp version 2 can still be used for a limited time at [ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch](https://ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch).
However, the code is difficult to maintain and updates can no longer be installed.
The creation of new camps on eCamp v2 has now been deactivated. No data will be migrated from v2 to v3.
We recommend that you download old camps that you want to keep as PDF files and archive them yourself, and switch to eCamp v3 as soon as possible.
