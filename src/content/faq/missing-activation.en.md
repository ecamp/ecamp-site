title: I did not receive an activation email. What can I do?
---

You can request a new activation email [here](https://app.ecamp3.ch/resend-activation). If that doesn't work either, you can reset your password or log in with MiData, CeviDB, jubla.db, or Google using an account that uses the same email address as your eCamp v3 account. All of these actions will also activate your account.
